# Plan



## next
Not next as in next release, but as in next focus

 - rename the `tts` export type to `texture` and remove/change the limits
 - - or more likely have both and make `tts` a subclass of `texture`
 - macros for `<ul>` and `<table>` tags
 - support for markdown based text elements. You get less complexity, but you get a more friendly experience
 - some sort of alt art mechanism for image elements. specify an image to load if the desired are doesn't exist, like `src: path\art.png; noArt: path\noArt.png`
 - svg support

## soon
 - line continues, a la python. so
    ```
    [if| [some test] | then do this complicated shit \
    | otherwise this this stuff \
    ]
    ```
   I might punt on this one, I think I wanna work on the semantics
 - take escapes out of parsing non values (did I do this already?)
 - macros for `[dup| ]` to conditionally render text depending on repeat
 - - like `[1st| |\s]` would return `[]` on the first go thru and `\s` after
 - - `[first| TRUE | FALSE ]` `[last| TRUE | FALSE ]` would cover it  I think
 - - or maybe `[when| FIRST | OTHER | LAST ]`
 - texture element type that allows you yo specify a specific area of the images to draw

## later
 - `inherit` value that means inherit from the container (what would this do if the parent is of a different type?)
 - a working directory folder property, like `folder: ` that specifies a folder that contains the resources and output folder
 - `[cardName]`
 - `[print| STRING ]` prints a string to the console
 - `[asset| prop ]` inspect the current asset? maybe just get the unevaluated value
 - yaml based layouts, that could either be generated by another app, or just as an alternative to CLS
 - custom types, basically defaults turned up to 11.
    ```
    types {
      upsidedown {
        type: image
        rotation: 180
      }
    }
    ```
    The real question is if/how to handle sub elements. I'm also thinking a `[value]` variable that evaluates to the value the user provides. Maybe consider giving them a way to have custom properties
 - `rotation-origin` to define the center of rotation

## far off
A lot of these are hypothetical, and may never get implemented
 - automatic shrink-to-fit functionality with full rich text capabilities
 - `c` sign or prefix on positions to allow centering by the center of the element?
 - font from files
 - - still not sure if it's possible
 - linux support 
 - - this just might be distributing the python source
 - look at different back ends, but it's hard to find one that supports both images in strings *and* selecting open type features

 - deeper integration of operator macros, like 
    ```
    x: # 1/8in + 1/4in
    text: [dup|# 4 + 5| asdf]
    ```
   the idea being they act like ? in `[if| ]`, so when they get seen the value immediately gets dispatched to the macro. Make them first class. 
   - maybe also give operator macros `frame` made in generate
 - image magick element types, for pango and drop shadows


## probably not gonna happen

### if this happens, it'll be so far down the line I'll have rewritten most of CLS by then
 -  plugin support?
 - json based data? (i'm not sure what the point of this was)
 - - array of object, each object is an asset and each kv pair is a column macro maybe?
 - - The ability to set specific values for each asset???
 not a bad idea, not a great one either
 - better toggle handler with custom true and false values
### I'm limiting the amount of drawing that can be done with CLS on purpose, too much and it can be hard to read
 - polygons and polylines
 - gradients?
 - color macros, like `[hsl| H| S| L]` that emit a color string
 - -  OR a distinct color type that generate QColors, asColor if you will
 - - something like `color = hsl|12|67|67` or `color = hsl(12,67,67)`?
 - - maybe `(hsl, 12, 67, 67)` and go full lisp?
 - - `hsl` is a keyword for interp'ing `(12, 67, 67)` which is a list like `color: hsl (12, 67, 67)`
### redundant
 - `[=| NAME | VALUE ]` - change the value of the element's property
 - `[macro| name | value ]` define a macro
